## Methodology Documentation

### Data Collection Method
**Primary Source:** Etherscan API for comprehensive transaction history
- Complete transaction records for each wallet
- Compound V2/V3 protocol interaction analysis  
- Current balance and historical patterns
- Failed transaction rate calculation
- Counterparty diversity metrics

**Backup Methods:** 
- Web3 direct blockchain queries via Infura/Alchemy
- Graceful fallback for API limitations
- Demo mode with realistic simulated data

### Feature Selection Rationale
The system uses 7 weighted risk factors based on DeFi lending risk research:

1. **Protocol Experience (25% weight)** - Most critical factor
   - Compound interaction count and complexity
   - Rationale: DeFi experience correlates with risk understanding

2. **Transaction Volume (20% weight)** - Financial capacity indicator
   - Total historical ETH volume transacted
   - Rationale: Higher volume users are more established

3. **Transaction Frequency (15% weight)** - Engagement measure
   - Average transactions per day over activity period
   - Rationale: Regular activity shows ongoing monitoring

4. **Balance Stability (15% weight)** - Stake in ecosystem
   - Current ETH balance and balance-to-volume ratio
   - Rationale: Higher balance = more skin in the game

5. **Transaction Failure Rate (10% weight)** - Competence indicator
   - Percentage of failed transactions
   - Rationale: High failure rate suggests poor understanding

6. **Counterparty Diversity (10% weight)** - Ecosystem participation
   - Number of unique addresses interacted with
   - Rationale: Broader participation reduces concentration risk

7. **Recent Activity (5% weight)** - Current engagement
   - Time since last transaction and recent activity patterns
   - Rationale: Recent activity indicates current awareness

### Scoring Method
**Algorithm:** Weighted linear combination
```
Risk Score = Σ(Factor Score × Weight) × 1000
```

**Normalization:** Each factor scored 0-1 (1 = highest risk)
- Logarithmic scaling for volume metrics
- Percentile-based ranking for relative assessment
- Time decay weighting for recency

**Risk Categories:**
- 0-200: Very Low Risk (Highly experienced)
- 201-400: Low Risk (Experienced with good record)
- 401-600: Medium Risk (Moderate experience/concerns)
- 601-800: High Risk (Limited experience/poor patterns)
- 801-1000: Very High Risk (New/problematic users)

### Risk Indicator Justification

#### Why These Factors Are Critical for DeFi Lending:

**1. Protocol Experience (Highest Weight - 25%)**
- DeFi protocols involve complex financial mechanics
- Understanding collateralization, liquidation risks is crucial
- Historical Compound usage demonstrates practical knowledge
- Experienced users make fewer costly mistakes

**2. Transaction Volume (20%)**
- Indicates financial sophistication and resources
- Larger transactions suggest understanding of gas optimization
- Higher volume correlates with ability to handle losses
- Volume-to-balance ratio shows financial management skills

**3. Behavioral Patterns (Combined 40%)**
- Transaction frequency shows engagement and monitoring
- Low failure rates indicate preparation and understanding
- Counterparty diversity suggests broader ecosystem knowledge
- Recent activity indicates current market awareness

**4. Financial Stability (15%)**
- Current balance shows commitment to ecosystem
- Balance stability indicates long-term perspective
- Higher balances provide cushion for potential losses
